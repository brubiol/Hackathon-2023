# Welcome to FlexiFrenzy 
## Inspiration
Inspiration was born within us from the vast amount of motivation given to us from people pushing to better ourselves.
## What it does
Fitness tracker that incorporates a social media aspect where you are able to see your friends working out and holds each other accountable.
## How we built it
We built the front-end with React, Javascript, and tailwind css  daisy UI. For the Back-end we used app-write to host our database and our data needs.

## Challenges we ran into
Having to work through the night to achieve something we were truly content and acceptable to our standards for all of our first hackathon performance

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that for our first hackathon we were able to build a visually appealing app that has a good purpose and can actually help people with just a little more development.

## What we learned
We learned a lot about the workflow of a software engineer building a real app and using github and messing up github to achieve a final good workflow.

## What's next for FlexiFrenzy.tech
We would want to be able to see if people are interested in the idea and seeing if we can expand on our project,
